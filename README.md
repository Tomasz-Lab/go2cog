#Mapping Gene Ontology (GO) IDs to Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) categories.

This tool allows mapping Go terms to one of the 26 COG categories as in NCBI database: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog/

In addition, these COG categories were further aggregated to 3 SuperCOG groups: Cellular Processing and Signaling, Metabolism and Informations Storage and Processing. This aggregation is useful in analyzing large datasets.
